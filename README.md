# Data-Science-Projects

Welcome to Catherine's Data Science Projects repo! This is where I store some of the projects that I have been working on!

1. **West Nile Virus prediction project**
   - **West Nile Virus Modeling** is a leading cause of mosquito-borne illness in the United States. Forecasting when and where WNV outbreaks might occur is an essential task for mosquito control programs.To monitor, mosquito control programs maintain and monitor many different mosquito traps in their district. Each day, workers test these traps by counting the number of mosquitos and testing if any mosquitos are WNV positive. Finding a large number of traps with WNV positive mosquitos -> the local population is at severe risk of WNV infection. Waiting for traps to test positive means that it will be too late to take preventative action. Instead, Mosquito control programs use statistical methods to forecast if an outbreak of WNY is likely in the next several days. These models use historical outbreak information, spatial information, climate variables, and demographic data to help predict when and where WNV is likely to occur. 
   - The **main objective** for this project is to build a forecasting model to predict the prevalence of WNV across Chicago one, two, and three weeks in advance.
